## 🚀 About Me

I'm an **Integration Engineer** with deep expertise across enterprise middleware, cloud-native platforms, and infrastructure reliability. I specialize in designing, building, and supporting scalable, resilient systems using technologies like **IBM MQ**, **IBM DataPower**, **Event Streams (Kafka)**, **OpenShift**, **Docker**, and **Tekton**.

My passion lies in **automation**, **observability**, and **operational excellence**—turning complex integration challenges into clean, reliable, and maintainable solutions.

I live at the **intersection of infrastructure, integration, and DevOps**, where I help teams ship faster, fail less, and operate with confidence. Whether I'm:
- 🚀 Crafting automated CI/CD pipelines with Tekton and GitOps
- ⚡ Tuning high-availability messaging systems (MQ, MFT, DataPower)
- 📊 Strengthening monitoring with Splunk and custom tooling
- 🔄 Modernizing legacy integration patterns

I approach every problem with an **engineering-first mindset**, building systems that work reliably across environments and stand the test of time.

**What I bring to any team:** The ability to turn operational pain into scalable, engineered solutions—solutions that are secure, observable, and built to last.
