## 🚀 About Me

I'm a **DevOps, SRE, Platform Engineer, and Software Developer** with strong hands-on experience across:
- ☁️ Cloud platforms & infrastructure automation
- 🔄 CI/CD pipelines & GitOps workflows
- 📦 Container orchestration (OpenShift, Docker)
- ⚡ Event-driven systems & enterprise integration
- 🛡️ High-availability & disaster recovery patterns

I've architected and operated production systems using **Red Hat OpenShift**, **Tekton**, **IBM MQ**, **IBM Event Streams**, **IBM DataPower**, and cloud automation tools—designing reliable systems, improving deployment workflows, and solving operational challenges in enterprise environments.

I constantly push myself to learn and improve. I'm ready to join modern engineering teams where I can **architect, automate, ship, and support systems at scale**.
